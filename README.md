# Spotify Bot Thingy

This is a spotify bot that uses the Spotify APIs and the Spotify SDK

I think it still works but you WILL get caught.

Uses flask to manage the sessions and react on the front end to manage API endpoints and, ofcourse, the SDK.

I don't know if I have the source code for the front-end anymore, but I will check and upload that if I find it.

Note:
	Please add your client id from the spotify dev site to the spotify.py where it says <client_id> and your secret key (I think) to where it says <i_think_the_secret_key>
